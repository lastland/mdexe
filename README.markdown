What is mdexe?
==============

You always read markdown files learning how to do something on your computer. Those files might tell you to execute some command, append some text in some files, or something similar. Well, wouldn't these be more simple if this markdown files can be executed automaticly?

mdexe means "markdown can be executed". For example, just try typing `python mdexe.py exec README.markdown` in your shell, the following echo statement would be executed.

Exec:

    echo "Hello mdexe!"

mdexe is very simple and stupid now. I'm still working on it to make it better and smarter.
